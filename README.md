Note:

This version of the project works well if you expect around a thousand viewers per week.
But it is **not designed to scale** beyond that.

If you want a highly scalable version, contact me at **[ansimran@protonmail.com](mailto:ansimran@protonmail.com)**.

The main goal here is to **showcase Machine Learning skills**, not full-stack AI development skills.

For an example of my work in full-stack AI development with scalability in mind, you can check this project:

## Further details about this Project
### Classifying Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using Photometric Data
#### The project tries to classify Quasars, Galaxies and Stars using photometric data.
#### Motivations:
Large catalogs of unlabelled stellar objects are available. Labelling these stellar objects is important for a number of reasons. E.g: for statistical poulation analyses and for [testing cosmological models](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/444/1/2/1016765) to name a few. Although these stellar objects can be classified by analyzing their optical spectrums but that process is time consuming. [Next generation of telescopes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873..111I/abstract) will increase the quantity of available unlabelled data even more! That's why I have tried to use the photometric data and a combination of machine learning approaches to label the stellar objects.

## Pre-Deployment Results
The results were:
- For objects correctly_classified as Quasars, 90.3% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Quasar.
- For objects correctly_classified as Galaxies, 86.7% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Galaxy.
- For objects correctly_classified as Stars, 99.6% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Star.
